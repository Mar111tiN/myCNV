########### GENOMIC COVERAGE ############
# takes normal bam files downstream of samtools view 
# processes the cigar string for coverage computation
# PARAMETER:
#     $1 is minimal coverage to be output
# USAGE:
# samtools bam_file [region] | bamCoverage 0
# OUTPUT:
#   Chr Pos Coverage
# !!! only outputs positions where the coverage is changing
# this makes it sparse
